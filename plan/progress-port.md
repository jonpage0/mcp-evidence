## Milestones

- [x] Project setup complete
- [x] Core modules implemented
- [x] MCP server functioning (with listing capabilities)
- [x] Vitest tests passing for most functionality
- [ ] DuckDB query functionality fully working
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] Package ready for publishing

## Implementation Notes

### Setup

- Original Python code is in `/python-version` directory
- Existing `/sources` and `/.evidence` directories contain real production data (do not modify)
- Using TypeScript with Vitest for testing

### Config Module

- Implemented Config class that handles project path, data path discovery
- Added support for finding data in both standard Evidence.dev locations and in the sources directory
- Added command-line argument handling with validation

### Discovery Module

- Implemented Discovery module with support for both manifest formats
- Added directory scanning as a fallback mechanism
- Added support for SQL files in addition to Parquet files
- Implemented schema discovery from schema.json files

### Database Module

- Implemented DuckDB interface for querying Parquet files
- Added connection management to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented view registration for all discovered tables
- Added comprehensive error handling and query execution
- Encountered issues with DuckDB initialization

### MCP Server

- Created MCP server using the official TypeScript SDK
- Implemented resource handlers for data sources and queries
- Implemented tool handlers for all operations
- Added support for SQL query execution through MCP

### Testing with Vitest

- Created comprehensive tests for all modules
- Successfully configured tests to work with real data from the sources directory
- Added proper mocking for MCP server components

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all classes and methods
- Created detailed README with installation and usage instructions
- Added examples for both CLI and programmatic usage
- Added documentation for Cline/Roo-Cline integration

### Challenges and Solutions

- **TypeScript Module Resolution**: Resolved module import issues by configuring TypeScript for ES modules
- **DuckDB Integration**: Attempted to adapt Python DuckDB API calls to work with the Node.js DuckDB package, but encountered compatibility issues with "duckdb.Database is not a constructor" error
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for all operations using proper TypeScript typing
- **Config Discovery**: Implemented robust path discovery for Evidence.dev data sources that falls back gracefully
- **Testing with Real Data**: Successfully configured tests to use the actual sources directory, making tests more valuable

## Known Issues and Next Steps

1. **DuckDB Integration**: Currently, the DuckDB integration shows "duckdb.Database is not a constructor" error when attempting to query. This requires:
   - Potentially migrating to @duckdb/node-api (the newer DuckDB client)
   - Updating the database.ts module to use the new API with async/await pattern
   - Testing with real SQL files

2. **SQL File Reading**: The current implementation assumes SQL files can be treated like parquet files. Further work is needed to:
   - Parse SQL files content
   - Execute them properly as queries
   - Handle SQL result formatting

## Completion Status

The TypeScript port of the Evidence.dev MCP server is complete with one outstanding issue:

- ✅ All core modules implemented
- ✅ Source and table discovery working correctly
- ✅ MCP server and tools implemented
- ❌ Query functionality (DuckDB integration) needs additional work
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Build process working correctly
- ⚠️ Package structure ready for publishing (after DuckDB issue is resolved)

The server can list sources and tables through MCP tools, but querying data requires the DuckDB integration to be fixed.
