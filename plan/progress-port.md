## Implementation Notes

### Setup

*Add notes about project setup here*

- Original Python code is in `/python-version` directory
- Existing `/sources` and `/.evidence` directories contain real production data (do not modify)
- Will use TypeScript with Vitest for testing

### Config Module

- Implemented Config class that handles project path, data path discovery
- Added support for finding data in both standard Evidence.dev locations and in the sources directory
- Added command-line argument handling with validation

### Discovery Module

- Implemented Discovery module with support for both manifest formats
- Added directory scanning as a fallback mechanism
- Added support for SQL files in addition to Parquet files
- Implemented schema discovery from schema.json files

### Database Module

- Implemented DuckDB interface for querying Parquet files
- Added connection management to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented view registration for all discovered tables
- Added comprehensive error handling and query execution

### MCP Server

- Created MCP server using the official TypeScript SDK
- Implemented resource handlers for data sources and queries
- Implemented tool handlers for all operations
- Added support for SQL query execution through MCP

### Testing with Vitest

- Started unit testing with Config module tests
- Set up Vitest configuration for the project
- Added mocking for file system operations

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all classes and methods
- Created detailed README with installation and usage instructions
- Added examples for both CLI and programmatic usage

### Challenges and Solutions

- **TypeScript Module Resolution**: Resolved module import issues by configuring the project to use ES modules and proper import paths
- **DuckDB Integration**: Adapted the Python DuckDB API calls to use the Node.js DuckDB package
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for all operations
- **Config Discovery**: Implemented robust path discovery for Evidence.dev data sources
