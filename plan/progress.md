# Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Implementation Complete

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Initialize plan document
- [x] Initialize progress tracking document
- [x] Analyze existing DuckDB MCP server codebase
- [x] Understand Evidence.dev data structure
- [x] Design modifications for Evidence.dev compatibility
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan with timeline
- [x] Update server configuration for Evidence.dev project paths
- [x] Implement Evidence data discovery functionality
- [x] Modify DuckDB interface to work with parquet files
- [x] Create Evidence-specific MCP tools
- [x] Implement resources for exposing source schemas
- [x] Remove write functionality
- [x] Document the new MCP server with detailed README

### Known Issues
- [x] The DuckDB import error in the IDE is likely due to the development environment not having DuckDB installed. The code includes proper error handling for missing dependencies.

## Summary of Implementation

- **Configuration**: Updated to use Evidence.dev project paths and find data directories
- **Data Discovery**: Implemented robust discovery of Evidence data sources with manifest.json parsing
- **Query Interface**: Created a DuckDB interface for direct parquet file querying
- **MCP Tools**: Added Evidence-specific tools for listing sources, tables, and executing queries
- **Resources**: Implemented resource handlers to expose source schemas
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- **Documentation**: Created detailed README with installation and usage instructions

## Architecture Overview

The Evidence.dev MCP server now follows this flow:
1. Takes an Evidence.dev project path as input
2. Locates the `.evidence/template/static/data` directory
3. Discovers all data sources and their parquet files
4. Provides MCP tools to interact with the discovered data
5. Allows SQL queries on the parquet files using DuckDB

## Next Steps (For Further Development)

1. Add unit tests for the server components
2. Improve error messages and logging
3. Implement more advanced query capabilities 
4. Consider adding support for other Evidence.dev data formats
